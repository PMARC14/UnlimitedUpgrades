**Unlimited Upgrades** is a mod for *House of the Dying Sun* that removes the default 2-slot limit on player ships, allowing you to equip as many Field Upgrades (modifiers) as you want on any ship in your fleet!

---

## Features

- **No Upgrade Limits**: Equip 3, 5, 10, or all available upgrades simultaneously on your Interceptors, Destroyers, and Capital ships.
- **Checklist Toggle Selection**: Upgrades in the selection grid act as toggles—click an unequipped modifier to equip it, or click an equipped modifier to unequip/remove it. No tedious slot swapping required!
- **Smooth Slot Scrolling**: The ship overview hangar UI uses a responsive sliding window:
  - **Mouse Wheel**: Hover your cursor over the modifier slots and scroll up or down.
  - **Keyboard / Controller**: Navigate with **Arrow Keys / WASD / Controller D-pad**; the slots auto-scroll when reaching the edge.
  - **Quick Add Slot**: An empty slot is always appended to the end of the scroll list so you can easily add new upgrades.
- **Capital Ship Crash Safeguards**: Built-in compatibility filters automatically prevent invalid fighter-only modifiers from being attached to capital ships, ensuring zero mission crashes or glitches.
- **Save & Load Compatible**: Seamlessly integrates with the game's save system and the `GameSaves` mod.
